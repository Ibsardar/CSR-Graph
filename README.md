# CSR-Graph

Executes some famous search algorithms on a compressed sparse row graph (typically used for relational data storage).

## Algorithms:

**Input to Matrix to CSR**
 - *Convert User Input File to Adjacency Matrix then to CSR Graph*

**Breadth-First Search**

**Depth-Fisrt Search**

**Prim's**

**Atriculation Point Detection**
 - *Using AssignLow*
 
**Dijkstra**
 - *Single Shortest Path*
